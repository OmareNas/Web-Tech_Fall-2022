					<p>My name is Erasmo Sanchez Jr, I am a student of computer science at UTSA</p>
					<p>
						Hello! Once again my name is Erasmo Sanchez Jr, and my major is computer science concentaration software engineering and <br/>
						trying to minor in cyber security at UTSA. My favorite food is the Enchiladas Suizas. Some of my favorite hobbies are video<br/> games,  reading comics or books, coding, and music. I'm currently trying to learn about computer vision by looking at <br/>
						the OpenCV directory, and practicing with CTF problems.  I have participated in various competitions and hackathons in and <br/>
						out of school that focus on group building and trying to finish a project in a short amount of time. I believe I am the tech-savvy<br/> 
						of the family, but I still feel I don't know anything. My first experience with computers was in fifth grade when my parents bought me a Laptop. That is when, I learned not to trust everything or click on random links by getting my computer infected with a virus. The first time I started to code was during 11th grade on a robotics team.

						I am a dog person,  but I also like cats. I have a dog name Flaca, and she is a rescue dog. My brother got her from one of our neighbors and was told that when arrived at my neighbor's place she was skinny, so that is how she got her name Flaca meaning skinny in Spanish.  She likes to play fetch and is super affections. Below is an image of her.
